# Simple-Interest-Calculation-and-Project-Documentation
This project is designed to demonstrate how to calculate simple interest using a simple shell script (simple-interest.sh) 📝. It provides an easy-to-understand approach to financial calculations, helping users learn about the importance of interest rates, time, and principal amounts in real-world financial scenarios 💰. The script takes user inputs for the principal, interest rate, and time period, then computes the simple interest, making it a great starting point for those learning shell scripting and financial calculations 💡.

In addition to the core functionality, the project includes essential project documentation, ensuring that developers and contributors have a clear understanding of the project's purpose and guidelines 📚. This includes:

Apache 2.0 License for open-source usage and distribution 📜
A README.md file that provides detailed instructions on how to use the script 🛠️
A Code of Conduct to promote a positive and inclusive community 🙌
Contributing Guidelines to encourage collaboration and best practices 🤝
This project is not only a useful tool for calculating interest but also a perfect example of well-documented open-source development 🚀.
